Propositional Logic: states a fact;
	logical symbols => represent facts. (S, R, Q)
	Connectives symbols => to relates the fact (not, and or)
	Implications => implies only if the second condition to be true.
	Biconditional => if only and only be true.
	model => assign a fact to each symbol either true or false.
	entailment => alpha entails beta; means that both are true
	infernce => dreving new sentence from old.

Algorithms:
	Model Check:
		Enumerate through all the possible models.
		KB = True and query = True.
	Inference Rule:
		set premis and reach the conclusion.
	
	Important concepts.
	And Elimination:
	Double Negation Eimination
	inpication elimination: if then => or.
	biconditionl elimination.	
	Demorgans law:
	moving negation inside.
	Distributive property.
