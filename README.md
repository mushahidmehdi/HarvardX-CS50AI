# HarvardX-CS50AI
CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python on edX is Havard University introductory course for students who is interested to learn about artificial intelligence, `CS50 is prerequisites`.

The course covered 19 assignments in total, including 7 quiz assignments and 12 programming assignments. The programming assignments are included in individual folders and can be easily redeployed using pip with the requirements if needed. The problems solved in the assignments are described below. The quiz assignments are out of scope of this repository.

### Week 0 - Search   

The initial module covered traditional algorithms aimed at finding preferrably optimal or near-optimal ways of completing a task that can be converted to a problem of "finding a path between two points pertaining minimal cost incurred".

Algorithms covered:
- `Depth-First Search`
- `Breadth-First Search`
- `Greedy best-first search`
- `A * search`
- `MiniMax`
- `Alpha-Beta Pruning`
- `Depth-Limited Minimax ` 

  
 
### Project 0a: Degrees

The first project utilizes the breadth-first search algorithm to find the so-called "degrees of separation" between two actors, also known as the "Six degrees of Kevin Bacon".
